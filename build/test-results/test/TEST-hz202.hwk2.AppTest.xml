Invalid command!
Player A, you are going place Sally’s stash on the board. Make sure Player B isn’t looking! For each stack, type the coordinate of the upper left side of the stash, followed by either H (for horizontal) or V (for vertical) for green and purple ones, and U (for up) or R (for right) or D (for down) or L (for left) for red and blue ones. For example, M4H would place a stack horizontally starting at M4 and going to the right. You have
		2 Green stacks that are 1x2
		3 Purple stacks that are 1x3
		3 Red superstacks that are T-shape
		3 Blue crazystacks that are Z-shape

This is your whole placement.
Now switching to the other player. Press any key to continue:
Player B, you are going place Sally’s stash on the board. Make sure Player A isn’t looking! For each stack, type the coordinate of the upper left side of the stash, followed by either H (for horizontal) or V (for vertical) for green and purple ones, and U (for up) or R (for right) or D (for down) or L (for left) for red and blue ones. For example, M4H would place a stack horizontally starting at M4 and going to the right. You have
		2 Green stacks that are 1x2
		3 Purple stacks that are 1x3
		3 Red superstacks that are T-shape
		3 Blue crazystacks that are Z-shape

Player A, you are going place Sally’s stash on the board. Make sure Player B isn’t looking! For each stack, type the coordinate of the upper left side of the stash, followed by either H (for horizontal) or V (for vertical) for green and purple ones, and U (for up) or R (for right) or D (for down) or L (for left) for red and blue ones. For example, M4H would place a stack horizontally starting at M4 and going to the right. You have
		2 Green stacks that are 1x2
		3 Purple stacks that are 1x3
		3 Red superstacks that are T-shape
		3 Blue crazystacks that are Z-shape

This is your whole placement.
Now switching to the other player. Press any key to continue:
Player B, you are going place Sally’s stash on the board. Make sure Player A isn’t looking! For each stack, type the coordinate of the upper left side of the stash, followed by either H (for horizontal) or V (for vertical) for green and purple ones, and U (for up) or R (for right) or D (for down) or L (for left) for red and blue ones. For example, M4H would place a stack horizontally starting at M4 and going to the right. You have
		2 Green stacks that are 1x2
		3 Purple stacks that are 1x3
		3 Red superstacks that are T-shape
		3 Blue crazystacks that are Z-shape
